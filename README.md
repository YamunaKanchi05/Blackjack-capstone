# Blackjack-capstone
It deals with the deck of cards
An initial 2 card hand composed of an ace and a face card is called a blackjack and is the best possible hand. After the first round of dealing, each player has the option to hit (receive more cards) or stay (no more cards). If hitting results in the player busting (total going over 21), then his or her bet is lost.
